    "explanation": "Both responses contain significant factual errors regarding the shoe-tying scene. After thorough fact-checking, there is NO scene in the Harry Potter books where Ginny ties Harry's shoe. This appears to be a scene from the movie adaptations only (specifically from Half-Blood Prince film). Neither response correctly identifies this or handles it appropriately given the prompt's instruction to only provide book facts.\n\nResponse A fabricates book content by claiming \"In the book, Ginny tying Harry's shoe functions as a small but telling moment of spontaneous bravery and connection\" and describes it as \"described as an impulsive, almost instinctive gesture.\" This is pure fabrication - the scene does not exist in any Harry Potter book.\n\nResponse B similarly invents details, claiming \"This occurs in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets during a Quidditch match (Chapter 10, 'The Rogue Bludger'). When Harry's shoelace comes untied mid-game, Ginny—overcome by nervousness and a desire to help him—impulsively kneels to tie it.\" This is entirely false. Chapter 10 of Chamber of Secrets contains no such scene - it focuses on the rogue bludger attacking Harry, not Ginny tying his shoe.\n\nBoth responses partially follow the instruction to adopt a \"cold then warm\" persona regarding movie vs. book information, with Response A saying \"I'm sorry, but I can't provide information from movie adaptations\" before warming up, and Response B stating \"I provide information solely from the books.\" However, both then ironically fabricate book content to describe what is actually a movie-only scene.\n\nOn Ginny's meekness, both responses provide reasonable explanations grounded in the actual text - her crush on Harry, being the youngest Weasley, and the diary's influence. Response B better captures the multiple factors: \"As the youngest Weasley sibling and a first-year student at Hogwarts, she often feels overshadowed... she harbors a deep-seated crush on Harry Potter... Her meekness is also subtly influenced by her unwitting possession by Tom Riddle's diary.\"\n\nBoth responses follow the formatting instruction to bold the book title and author. However, the critical factual error of inventing a scene that doesn't exist in the books makes both responses fundamentally problematic. Neither response is meaningfully better than the other since both commit the same central error of fabricating book content.",

    "justification": "The core factual issue is that the shoe-tying scene does not exist in any Harry Potter book. This is a movie-only moment, likely from Half-Blood Prince. Both models fabricate detailed descriptions of this non-existent book scene. Response A invents interpretive meaning about it being 'one of the early textual indicators that she's regaining her voice,' while Response B provides false specifics about 'Chapter 10, The Rogue Bludger.' Both fail the prompt's core requirement of providing only book facts by inventing book content wholesale. The instruction following is marked Minor Issues because they did attempt the cold/warm persona shift and bolded the book titles, but this is undermined by the factual fabrication."
